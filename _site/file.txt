Homeless shelters need our help. 

Many amazing people put in countless hours of work to help shelters serve their communities. Despite their immense and admirable efforts, the number of homeless people continues to rise, and the pressure on shelters is growing fast. 

We met with local shelters and learned about all the tools that keep their operation moving. We saw a need, so we built ShelterBoost.

ShelterBoost serves as mission control. Among other functionalities, it automates repetitive tasks, secures and centralizes the shelter's data, and provides productivity tools that are not only efficient, theyâ€™re sleek and user-friendly too.

But here's the game-changer: ShelterBoost is a no-code platform. Shelters can now easily tailor their dashboard to their ever-changing needs, putting customization in the hands of those who know their shelters best.

ShelterBoost's launch begins this month, and we are eager to talk with more shelters about their challenges and how a technology partnership with ShelterBoost can help to overcome them.
